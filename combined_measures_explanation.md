# Explanation of Combined Measures (PCA)

Combined Measure 1 explains 87.6% of the data variance.
Combined Measure 2 explains 7.0% of the data variance.

Component weights (how each original test contributes to each combined measure):

| Measure | MMSE | CDRSB | ADAS11 | ADAS13 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Combined Measure 1 | -0.491 | 0.48 | 0.514 | 0.515 |
| Combined Measure 2 | -0.249 | 0.723 | -0.461 | -0.45 |

Interpretation hints:
- A positive weight means the original test increases the combined measure value.
- A negative weight means the original test decreases the combined measure value.
- If Combined Measure 1 has large positive weights on impairment tests (ADAS) and negative on MMSE, higher Combined Measure 1 indicates worse impairment.
